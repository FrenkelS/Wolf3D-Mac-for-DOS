Macintosh Wolfenstein 3D ported to DOS
https://github.com/FrenkelS/Wolf3D-Mac-for-DOS

The Macintosh version of Wolfenstein 3D has different graphics, sound, music
and levels compared to the DOS version.
This is a port of the Macintosh version to DOS.
There are two versions: a 32-bit version and a 16-bit version.

The 32-bit version requires a 386 CPU and supports PC Speaker sound effects,
and digital sound effects through a Sound Blaster.
Music is supported via Adlib, Sound Blaster, Pro Audio Spectrum,
General MIDI, Wave Blaster and Sound Canvas.

The 16-bit version requires a 286 CPU and 2084 kB of XMS memory.
It only supports PC Speaker sound effects and no music.
64 kB of EMS memory is used, if available, as an upper memory block to store
data.

Both versions require a VGA graphics card.

It's based on the original Macintosh Wolfenstein 3D source release.
